## Notes on Improvements or Limitations
- Mood entries are stored in memory and lost on server restart. A database (e.g., MongoDB) could add persistence.
- No user authentication; anyone can post or view the feed.
- Image uploads lack size/type validation, which could be added for security.
- The UI is basic and could use styling and feedback (e.g., loading spinners).
